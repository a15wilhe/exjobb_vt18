# Install Instructions

Make sure you have a working install of apache2 and other needed packages. Look at the wiki page for this at [Configuring web server for LenaSYS installation](https://github.com/HGustavs/LenaSYS/wiki/Configuring-web-server-for-LenaSYS-installation) for further information.

To install a fresh copy of LenaSYS on your system an installes has been created called 'install.php'.
This installer is located in the LenaSYS directory.
What the installer will do is to help you create a new user in the MySQL database and a new database and fill it with some test data (if desired) to help you get started. It will also guide you through the steps necessary to link LenaSYS to this newly created database and get it running. 

1. To start the installation, put the LenaSYS directory at the place you want the system located. 
2. When the the directory is in the right place, go to the installer from a web browser of your choosing.
3. On this page you will have to fill out 6 fields (**NOTHING CAN BE LEFT EMPTY**).
* In the first field you will need to provide the desired username to be used in the database.
* A password for this user will be needed for identification when logging in to the database later. This will need to be filled in the next field.
* Provide the name of the database you want to use. You can use an existing database here and choose later if you want to write over it. If you dont want to write over you will need to provide a unique name.
* For hostname you will need to provide the name of the host the database is located on (standard is localhost).
* In the upper right two fields you will need to enter the credentials for root access (to get this - ask someone that have knowledge of this information).
* The last step is to fill the three boxes. The upper box should be checked if a new database with the provided name should be created (this will only initialize a new database for the site and create empty tables to hold information). 
* The second box should be checked if the created database should be filled with some test data (this includes some courses, users, etc.). This can be used to easily test the new installation of the system.
* The last box should be checked if you provided an existing database or/and user and wish to overwrite this. (**WARNING! THIS WILL DESTROY ALL PREVIOUS INFORMATION IN THIS DATABASE**).
4. When everything is filled, press 'Install!'.
5. The installer will automatically create all you need and fill the new database with data (if this was selected). If the first rows of the installation progress are GREEN (successull messages) it means everything was successfull and you will not need to do any further investigation.
* If you get error-messages (RED) that tells you something has failed - please check what went wrong and try again. A common error is that the creation of database or user failed because they already exist in the database (and you did not check the box that writes over the existing one).
* If you get other error messages (with weird exceptions and such) this will probably mean that connection failed (the hostname is incorrect or unavailable) or the root credentials were wrong. Please look this information up and try again.
6. There are two more steps to complete for the installation to be successful. The installer will, after successful creation of database, tell you what to do next but this will be explained here too (**though it's MUCH easier to read the installer instructions and just copy the two auto generated commands into BASH-shell and run them**)
* You will need to create a file named 'coursesyspw.php' outside the root directory of LenaSYS. If LenaSYS is located at /var/www/html/LenaSYS/ you will need to create this file at /var/www/html/ (**NOT IN THE LENASYS CATALOG**). In this file you will need to paste the code provided in the installer after installation. This code is:

```PHP
<?php
define("DB_USER","enter_user_here");
define("DB_PASSWORD","enter_password_here");
define("DB_HOST","enter_hostname_here");
define("DB_NAME","enter_database_here");
?>
```

enter_user_here = The username you provided as the new user.    
enter_password_here = The password you provided for this user.    
enter_hostname_here = The hostname you provided (where the databae is located, probably localhost).    
enter_database_here = The name of the new database you provided. IF you are using an old database (you did not create a new one) enter the database you wish to use here.    

* When this file is created and filled create a new directory at the same location as the file you just created (**NOT IN THE LENASYS DIRECTORY; ONE LEVEL UP**). Call this directory **'log'**.

```BASH
mkdir log
```

* Give the folder 'log' full permissions - in unix run the command:

```BASH
chmod 777 log
```

* Inside the log directory create a new sqlite database. Enter the directory 'log' and run the command (**IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE THE NAME loglena4.db OR ELSE IT WONT WORK**):

```BASH
sqlite3 loglena4.db ""
```

* Set full permissions on this file also with the command:

```BASH
chmod 777 loglena4.db
```



**The installation should now be completed and the website should be linked to the database.**
#### CONGRATULATIONS!



# Push notifications installation

**Note:** For the push notification system to work the server needs to use https, so make sure that is set up and valid. 

To set up https, look at the guide on this wiki page: [Getting a free ssl certificate and installing it when not having access to port 80](https://github.com/HGustavs/LenaSYS/wiki/Getting-a-free-ssl-certificate-and-installing-it-when-not-having-access-to-port-80)

**Note:** Only install if there is no other push notifications installation on the system already, if an installation already exists follow the guide further below for instructions for that.

1. To install the push notification subsystem first the following packages needs to be installed. The following commands assume the system is using php version 7.0. If you use another version, change all the 7.0 in the command below to the php version on your system and run the following command:

```BASH
sudo apt-get install php7.0-curl php7.0-gmp php7.0-mbstring
```

2. Install composer in your LenaSYS folder ( https://getcomposer.org/ )

3. Go into the LenaSYS folder run the following command. This command will download all the packages listed in the 'composer.json' file and download them to the 'vendor/' folder.

```BASH
php composer.phar install
```

4. Now open the 'coursesyspw.php' file created earlier during the initial installation of LenaSYS. The following settings need to be added in the bottom part of the file:

```PHP
define("PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY", "Insert your public key here");
define("PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY", "Insert your private key here");
define("PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_VAPID_EMAIL", "Insert your email address here");
```

If you do not have a private and public key already, you can use the tool at /DuggaSys/pushnotifications.php?action=genkeys to generate keys locally for usage. You need to be logged in as an administrator in LenaSys to use the tool. These keys should be shared to every installation on the same server.


## Copying a push notifications installation if it was already installed before

If another installation of LenaSys has push notification installed it is much simpler to copy that.

1. Find another installation of LenaSys with push notifications installed. In the following steps we will assume an installation exists at /[groupname]/[username]/LenaSYS

2. Copy the folder vendor/ from /[groupname]/[username]/LenaSYS to /[groupname]/[**YOUR**username]/LenaSYS

3. Open the file /[groupname]/[username]/coursesyspw.php and locate the rows containing code like this

```PHP
define("PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY", "Insert your public key here");
define("PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY", "Insert your private key here");
define("PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_VAPID_EMAIL", "Insert your email address here");
```

4. Copy that code from that file into /[groupname]/[**YOUR**username]/LenaSYS/coursesyspw.php
